# Tokoyami
 Tokoyami Discord bot for Cynagen
 
 I can't code, so don't expect too much
 
 ## Bot Token
 If you want to use the bot, you will need to create a file called 'token.txt' and paste your bot token into it.
 
 ## Configs
 To change which channel the bot will see as counting and announcement, you will need to go into 'data/config.json' and put your channel ID
